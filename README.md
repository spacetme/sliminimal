I am tired of Middleman project templates that come bundled with too many stuff.

So, this is a minimal and not-so-opinionated Middleman project template,
for development in:

- Slim
- Sass
- CoffeeScript


And common tools are included such as:

* LiveReload
* Autoprefixer


And some default configurations such as:

* Relative assets so you can host your files anywhere. Even in a file system or PhoneGap application!
* bower_components added into Sprocket's search path by default. If you use Bower, then it just works. If you don't, then this configuration doesn't do anything. How unobtrusive!


And now, choose your own CSS and JavaScript framework.

Be it jQuery, Angular, Ember, Polymer, Bootstrap, Bourbon, Bootstrap, Typeplate, Normalize, Modernizr, or write your own from scratch.
It's your choice! Don't want jQuery? Just expel it from Gemfile!
